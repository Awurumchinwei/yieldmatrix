You're right! I created the Yield Matrix smart contract but didn't provide the README yet. Here it is:

# Yield Matrix 🎯

An advanced yield aggregator protocol on Stacks blockchain featuring auto-compounding vaults, multi-strategy optimization, and institutional-grade risk management.

## 🚀 Overview

Yield Matrix maximizes DeFi returns through automated yield farming strategies, intelligent rebalancing, and compound optimization. Users deposit assets into vaults that automatically deploy capital across multiple strategies, harvesting and compounding yields to maximize APY.

## ✨ Core Features

### 1. **Auto-Compounding Vaults**
- Automated harvest and reinvestment
- Compound bounty system (1% reward)
- Gas-efficient share calculations
- Time-locked profit distribution

### 2. **Multi-Strategy System**
| Feature | Description | Benefit |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Multiple Strategies | Up to 5 per vault | Diversification |
| Risk Weighting | 0-1000 risk scores | Balanced exposure |
| Auto-Rebalancing | Threshold-based | Optimal allocation |
| Performance Tracking | Per-strategy metrics | Transparency |

### 3. **Risk Management**
- **Risk Scores**: 0-1000 scale assessment
- **Drawdown Limits**: Maximum loss protection
- **Volatility Monitoring**: Real-time tracking
- **Emergency Exits**: Quick withdrawal option

### 4. **Fee Structure**
| Fee Type | Rate | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Performance | 20% | Profit sharing |
| Management | 2% annual | Vault operations |
| Withdrawal | 0.5% | Liquidity protection |
| Emergency | 10% | Penalty for early exit |
| Compound Bounty | 1% | Harvester incentive |

### 5. **Security Features**
- 24-hour withdrawal cooldown
- Maximum capacity limits
- Share-based accounting
- Slippage protection
- Pause mechanism

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) >= 1.0.0
- [Stacks CLI](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/cli)
- Node.js >= 14.0.0
- Minimum 1 STX for deposits

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yield-matrix.git
cd yield-matrix

# Install dependencies
npm install
clarinet install

# Run tests
clarinet check
clarinet test
```

## 💻 Quick Start

### Deploy Contract
```bash
# Local deployment
clarinet console
> (deploy-contract 'yield-matrix)

# Testnet/Mainnet
clarinet deploy --testnet
clarinet deploy --mainnet
```

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Create Vault
```clarity
(contract-call? .yield-matrix create-vault 
    "STX High Yield"              ;; name
    'SP2...                        ;; asset token
    u100000000000                  ;; max capacity (100,000 STX)
)
```

#### 2. Deposit Assets
```clarity
(contract-call? .yield-matrix deposit 
    u1                             ;; vault-id
    u10000000                      ;; amount (10 STX)
)
```

#### 3. Harvest Yields
```clarity
;; Anyone can call harvest and earn bounty
(contract-call? .yield-matrix harvest u1)
```

#### 4. Withdraw Funds
```clarity
(contract-call? .yield-matrix withdraw 
    u1                             ;; vault-id
    u5000                          ;; shares to withdraw
)
```

## 📚 API Reference

### Vault Management

| Function | Description | Parameters | Access |
|----------|-------------|------------|--------|
| `create-vault` | Create new yield vault | `name, asset, max-capacity` | Admin |
| `add-strategy` | Add strategy to vault | `vault-id, name, allocation, risk` | Admin |
| `rebalance` | Rebalance vault strategies | `vault-id` | Admin |
| `set-vault-fees` | Update vault fees | `vault-id, perf-fee, mgmt-fee` | Admin |

### User Functions

| Function | Description | Parameters |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| `deposit` | Deposit assets into vault | `vault-id, amount` |
| `withdraw` | Withdraw assets from vault | `vault-id, shares` |
| `emergency-withdraw` | Exit with penalty | `vault-id` |
| `harvest` | Compound vault yields | `vault-id` |

### Read Functions

| Function | Description | Returns |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `get-vault` | Get vault details | Vault data |
| `get-user-balance` | Check user balance | Asset amount |
| `get-vault-apy` | Calculate current APY | APY percentage |
| `get-strategy` | Get strategy info | Strategy data |
| `get-risk-parameters` | Get risk metrics | Risk data |
| `get-protocol-stats` | Get global statistics | Protocol metrics |

## 💰 Yield Optimization

### How It Works
```
1. User Deposits → Receives vault shares
2. Vault Deploys → Capital to strategies
3. Strategies Earn → Generate yields
4. Harvest Called → Compounds profits
5. User Withdraws → Burns shares for assets + profits
```

### APY Calculation
```
Base Yield: 10% (strategy average)
Compound Frequency: Daily
Management Fee: 2% annual
Performance Fee: 20% of profits
Net APY: ~10.5% (after compounding)
```

### Risk Levels
| Score | Level | Description | Expected APY |
|-------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 800-1000 | Low | Stable strategies | 5-10% |
| 500-799 | Moderate | Balanced approach | 10-20% |
| 200-499 | High | Aggressive strategies | 20-50% |
| 0-199 | Extreme | Experimental | 50%+ |

## 🔒 Security

### Protection Mechanisms
1. **Cooldown Period**: 24-hour lock after deposit
2. **Share Accounting**: Prevents dilution
3. **Maximum Capacity**: Limits exposure
4. **Emergency Withdrawal**: Quick exit option
5. **Pause Function**: Crisis management

### Audit Considerations
- No external calls in critical paths
- Integer overflow protection
- Reentrancy guards
- Access control modifiers
- Slippage checks

## 📊 Vault Metrics

### Performance Indicators
- **TVL**: Total value locked in vault
- **APY**: Annual percentage yield
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns
- **Max Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Win Rate**: Profitable harvests percentage

### User Statistics
- Total deposits
- Current balance
- Profit/Loss
- Share percentage
- Rewards earned

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
clarinet test

# Specific tests
clarinet test --filter vault
clarinet test --filter harvest
clarinet test --filter emergency

# Coverage report
clarinet test --coverage
```
